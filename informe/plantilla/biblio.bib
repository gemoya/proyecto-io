abstract = "We present the talent scheduling problem and provide several hybrid genetic search algorithms for solving this problem. The problem is of scheduling the independent activities of a project (such as a movie) so that the cost of keeping talents (actors) on the project site when not needed is minimized. The problem is an NP-hard problem. The proposed hybrid algorithms use limited pairwise interchange heuristic procedure within the simple genetic algorithm framework. We report very impressive results on a set of problems with known optimal solutions. "
